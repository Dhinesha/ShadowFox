# Load the California housing dataset

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Evaluate the model

OUTPUT:
Mean Squared Error: 0.5558915986952442
R2 Score: 0.575787706032451
